## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, Chart.js

I used information provided by the ACT100 Index for the top 10 ranked companies. Bar charts are used for # of Employees and # of Branches, Pie chart for Mobile Cranes and Donut chart for Crawler Cranes for contrast.


## Optimizations

These charts could be broken up into Angular/React components for a more fluid SPA, perhaps with a toggle for each category
